# searchableList -- a list whose elements inherit from hasEquals
#
# In contrast to searchablelist, this uses ref type 'list' and not choice
# type 'list', so it is more flexible.
#
#
searchableList<A: hasEquals<A>>(from List<A>) : List<A>
is

  # create a list from this List.
  #
  redef asList => from.asList


  # does this list start with l?
  #
  startsWith (l List<A>) =>
    (searchablelist asList).startsWith l.asList


  # determine the index of element x within this list.  0 if x is at the
  # head of the list, 1 if it comes directly after head, etc. nil if x is
  # not in the list.
  #
  indexOf (x A) => find [x]

  # get the index of l within this list or nil if it does not exist
  #
  find (l List<A>) =>
    (searchablelist asList).find l.asList


  # replace all occurances of f by r
  #
  replace (f, r List<A>) =>
    (searchablelist asList).replace f.asList r.asList


  # get the number of matches of l
  #
  countMatchesOverlapping (l List<A>) =>
