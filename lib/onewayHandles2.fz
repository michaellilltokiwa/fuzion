# onewayHandles provide a means to create handles that refer to update-able
# cells using a one-way monad.
#
# onewayHandles is a one-way state monad. It provides features to create
# several handles that refer to modifiable value and features to 'get', 'put'
# or 'update' this value.
#
# This monad uses mutation of field onewayHandle2.val for better performance.
#
# NYI: handling of one-way monads is completely experimental
