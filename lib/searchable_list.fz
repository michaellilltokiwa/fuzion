# searchable_list -- a list whose elements inherit from has_equality
#
# In contrast to searchable_sequence, this uses choice type 'list' and not ref
# type 'Sequence', so it is more efficient.
#

searchable_list(A type : has_equality, from Sequence A) : Sequence A
/* : list A -- NYI: we might allow inherting from a choice to get a choice
                    with more restrictions on the type arguments

  also, if we could add a compile time check for the type of the actual generic
  such as

    pre
      A : has_equality

  Then, the inner features of searchableList could move to list.fz.
