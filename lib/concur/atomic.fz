atomic is

  # a reference that is created by atom
  # and needs to be passed to all atomic operations
  Atom(T type) ref is


  # creates an Atom
  atom(T type, init T) Atom T is intrinsic


  # read the current value of the atom
  read(T type, a Atom T) T is intrinsic


  # exchange the current value of the atom by
  # desired if the current value matches expected
  # weak version: may fail even if expected matches
  # returns if successful
  compare_exchange_weak(T type, a Atom T, expected T, desired T) bool is intrinsic
