# Test to check that explicit use of `ref` in outer types results in an error.
#
# The reason for this is that an outer type that is an explicit ref type is of
# no use since no values of such a type could be created since the values will
# have the original value type as their outer type or an (value or ref) heir type,
# which will not be assignable
#
