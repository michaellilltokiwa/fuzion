    A is
----^
Cyclic value field nesting would result in infinitely large objects.
Cycle of nesting found during clazz layout:
--CURDIR--/choice_negative.fz:30:7:
      x A | i32 | String := "Hello"  // 4. should flag an error: cyclic choice
------^

To solve this, you could change one or several of the fields involved to a reference type by adding 'ref' before the type.

      x i32 | A | String := "Hello"  // 5. should flag an error: cyclic choice
------^

To solve this, you could change one or several of the fields involved to a reference type by adding 'ref' before the type.
