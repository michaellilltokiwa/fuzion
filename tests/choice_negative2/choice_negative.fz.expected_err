Cyclic value field nesting would result in infinitely large objects.
Cycle of nesting found during clazz layout:

[34m      x A | i32 | String := "Hello"  // 4. should flag an error: cyclic choice
[33m------^[0m

To solve this, you could change one or several of the fields involved to a reference type by adding 'ref' before the type.
